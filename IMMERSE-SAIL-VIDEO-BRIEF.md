# Sawyer Business School Brand Video — Creative Brief
## "Where Ownership Is Built"
### IMMERSE × SAIL — Two Frameworks. One School.

---

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Build a **75-second cinematic brand video** for Suffolk University's Sawyer Business School. This is not a video about IMMERSE. This is not a video about SAIL. This is the video that shows how the two fit together — and why that combination is something no other business school in the country can offer.

**Target audience:** Prospective undergraduate and graduate students, their parents, admissions counselors, conference audiences, accreditation reviewers, industry partners, and university leadership.

**The question this video answers:** "Why Suffolk?"

**The answer:** Because Suffolk has two nationally recognized, award-winning frameworks working in concert — one for how you learn (IMMERSE), one for who you become (SAIL) — and together they produce graduates who don't just understand AI, they own the outcomes of working with it.

## ASPECT RATIO & FORMAT

**Primary:**
- Resolution: 1920 x 1080 (16:9 horizontal — this is a brand piece for presentations, website hero, conference screens)
- Frame rate: 30fps
- Duration: 2250 frames (75 seconds)
- Output: MP4

**Secondary:**
- Also create a 1080 x 1920 (9:16 vertical) version for social/mobile
- Adapted layouts, same content and timing

## THE STORY ARC (6 Scenes)

---

### Scene 1: THE GENERIC CLAIM (frames 0–210, 7 seconds)

**Concept:** Start with what every school says. Then break it.

Text appears in a clean, generic business-school style (deliberately sterile):

```
"Every business school talks about
real-world experience."
```

This should look like it could be from ANY school's brochure. Generic font treatment. Clean white-on-dark. Intentionally unremarkable.

Then — a visual crack, glitch, or disruption. The generic text fragments and dissolves. We're done with the generic version.

**Tone:** Polished boredom → disruption.

---

### Scene 2: THE IMMERSE REALITY (frames 210–840, 21 seconds)

**Concept:** Show what IMMERSE actually looks like. Fast, energetic, real. This should feel like a trailer for the most exciting school on earth.

**Opening beat (3 seconds):**
Text: "This is what it actually looks like."
— Sharp. Confident. Immediate.

**Then a rapid montage sequence (18 seconds):**

Each item gets 2-3 seconds. Represented as kinetic text + abstract visual motifs (since we're in Remotion, these are typographic/graphic, not photos):

1. **"Gillette Stadium"** — Students consulting on sustainability at an NFL venue
   - Visual: Stadium silhouette + data visualization overlays
   
2. **"Boston Celtics"** — Strategic partnership with an NBA franchise
   - Visual: Championship green accent + strategy diagrams
   
3. **"100,000 Real Orders"** — Prompt AIChemy competition
   - Visual: Data stream flowing, numbers counting
   
4. **"Make-A-Wish"** — Service learning with real nonprofit impact
   - Visual: Warm glow, connection lines
   
5. **"City of Boston"** — Tackling wicked problems for the actual city
   - Visual: City skyline silhouette + problem-mapping nodes
   
6. **"Student-Run Agency"** — Suffolk in the Hub, real clients, real campaigns
   - Visual: Creative burst, portfolio elements
   
7. **"Global Travel Seminars"** — International immersive experiences
   - Visual: Globe/map with route lines

Each card/moment should have the IMMERSE framework letter it maps to in a subtle badge:
- Gillette → [E] Experiential
- Celtics → [S] Synergistic
- 100K Orders → [I] Integrative
- Make-A-Wish → [E] Emotional
- City of Boston → [R] Relevant
- Student Agency → [M] Motivational
- Global → [M] Multisensory

**The montage should feel FAST, ALIVE, IMPRESSIVE.** This is the energy scene. The viewer should think: "Wait, they do ALL of that?"

At the end of the montage, a quick flash of all seven IMMERSE letters assembling:

**I · M · M · E · R · S · E**

With the tagline: "Immersive learning. Nationally recognized."
Smaller: "2024 Eduventures Innovation Award"

---

### Scene 3: THE PIVOT (frames 840–1050, 7 seconds)

**Concept:** The turn. Experience alone is not enough.

The energy pulls back. The screen calms. A single line appears:

```
"But experience without a framework
is just activity."
```

Hold for a beat. Let it land.

Then:

```
"What if the experience also developed
something AI cannot replicate?"
```

This is the bridge from IMMERSE to SAIL. The question that connects them.

**Tone:** Quiet. Thoughtful. The pause between the montage energy and the thesis.

---

### Scene 4: SAIL MEETS IMMERSE (frames 1050–1530, 16 seconds)

**Concept:** Show how SAIL competencies are forged inside IMMERSE experiences. This is the integration — the thing no other school has.

**Opening (3 seconds):**
The four SAIL letters appear: **S · A · I · L**
Below them: "AI Leadership Collaborative"
Smaller: "2025 Eduventures Innovation Award"

Two awards. Back to back. Let that register.

**Then four quick mappings (3 seconds each = 12 seconds):**

Each one shows a SAIL pillar paired with a real IMMERSE moment:

**S — Social Intelligence**
"How do we connect?"
→ "Presenting strategy to the Boston Celtics front office."
- Visual: The S letter + Celtics green accent + presentation motif
- The IMMERSE badge: [S] Synergistic

**A — AI Literacy**
"How does it work?"
→ "Analyzing 100,000 real orders with AI."
- Visual: The A letter + data flow + teal accent
- The IMMERSE badge: [I] Integrative

**I — Innovation / Inquiry**
"What's missing or wrong?"
→ "We need to make sure we're not penalizing rural sellers."
- Visual: The I letter + coral accent + magnifying lens
- The IMMERSE badge: [R] Relevant
- Subtle "— unprompted" label in coral

**L — Leadership**
"I will own what happens."
→ "Signing off on a recommendation to an actual client."
- Visual: The L letter + Suffolk gold + signature motif
- The IMMERSE badge: [E] Experiential
- This one should feel weightier. The gold is warmer. The animation is slower.

**The point:** Every SAIL competency is developed through an actual IMMERSE experience. Theory meets practice. Framework meets reality.

---

### Scene 5: THE THESIS (frames 1530–1830, 10 seconds)

**Concept:** The combined promise. The climax.

**Beat 1 (4 seconds):**
Both framework names appear side by side or stacked:

```
IMMERSE          SAIL
How you learn.   Who you become.
```

Connection lines form between them. They pulse together.

"Two award-winning frameworks. One school."

**Beat 2 (6 seconds):**
The thesis arrives in the three-beat rhythm:

```
"Skills can be automated."
"Judgment can be augmented."
"Ownership cannot."
```

Same treatment as the SAIL promo — escalating size, the word "Ownership" in Suffolk gold. But this time, below it:

```
"And ownership is built here."
```

That last line — "built here" — is new. It only makes sense in the context of IMMERSE. Ownership isn't taught in a lecture. It's BUILT through immersive experiences with real stakes.

---

### Scene 6: THE CLOSE (frames 1830–2250, 14 seconds)

**Concept:** Institutional credibility + call to action.

**Beat 1 (5 seconds):**
```
Suffolk University
Sawyer Business School
Boston, MA
```

Credentials (elegant, spaced, not cluttered):
- "AACSB Accredited"
- "2024 Eduventures Innovation Award — IMMERSE"
- "2025 Eduventures Innovation Award — SAIL"
- "Published in AACSB Insights"

**Beat 2 (5 seconds):**
```
suffolk.edu/business
```
A heartbeat pulse animation (The Pulse motif 🫀).

**Beat 3 (4 seconds):**
Fade to black. The final lingering text:

```
Where ownership is built.
```

## CRITICAL CREATIVE DIRECTION

1. **Scene 2 is the energy peak.** The IMMERSE montage should feel fast, impressive, alive. Think movie trailer pacing. Every card should make the viewer go "they do THAT?" Stack the most impressive partnerships — Celtics, Gillette, City of Boston — these aren't made up.

2. **Scene 3 is the hinge.** The one line — "But experience without a framework is just activity" — turns the entire video from a marketing reel into an intellectual argument. It should feel like someone stopped the music.

3. **Scene 4 is the integration.** Each SAIL pillar paired with a real IMMERSE experience. This is the unique value proposition. This is what no other school can show. Make each mapping feel like a revelation.

4. **Scene 5 is the climax.** Two frameworks appearing together, then the three-beat thesis, then "And ownership is built here." That last line — "built here" — only works because the viewer has just watched 60 seconds of proof that Suffolk BUILDS things through immersion.

5. **The "— unprompted" moment in Scene 4** (Innovation/Inquiry pillar) should still be a visual event. That coral label. It carries the same emotional weight as in the SAIL promo.

6. **This is 16:9 horizontal (primary), not 9:16 vertical.** This plays on screens at conferences, on the website hero, in Board presentations. Design for widescreen first.

7. **Both IMMERSE and SAIL should feel equally important.** Neither framework is subordinate. They are PARTNERS. Two columns of the same building.

8. **The consecutive awards are a flex. Let them flex.** "2024 Eduventures Innovation Award" and "2025 Eduventures Innovation Award" appearing together — back to back years — is powerful social proof. Don't bury it.

## DESIGN LANGUAGE

Use the same design system from DESIGN-SYSTEM.md (dark cinematic palette, Cormorant Garamond headlines, DM Sans body, Suffolk gold as primary accent) with these additions:

### IMMERSE-Specific Colors
```
--immerse-blue:    #1B3C73    /* Suffolk/institutional blue */
--celtics-green:   #007A33    /* Boston Celtics partnership */
--patriots-blue:   #002244    /* Gillette Stadium / Patriots */
--wish-blue:       #29ABE2    /* Make-A-Wish */
```

### Montage Pacing
- Each experience card: 80-90 frames (2.7-3 seconds)
- Cards should overlap transitions slightly (20 frame crossfade)
- Build energy: first cards are 90 frames, later ones compress to 75 frames
- End with a rapid-fire 30-frame flash of all IMMERSE letters assembling

### Framework Side-by-Side
When IMMERSE and SAIL appear together in Scene 5:
- IMMERSE on the left, SAIL on the right (in 16:9)
- IMMERSE on top, SAIL on bottom (in 9:16)
- Thin vertical (or horizontal) line between them
- Subtle glow where they connect — the integration point

Now build this. Make it the best thing Sawyer Business School has ever seen.
