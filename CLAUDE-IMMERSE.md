## IMMERSE Framework (Know This Deeply)

### What IMMERSE Is

IMMERSE is Suffolk University Sawyer Business School's pedagogical framework for immersive learning. It won the **2024 Eduventures Innovation Award** — one year before SAIL won the 2025 award. Two consecutive national innovation awards for the same school. That's the story.

IMMERSE stands for seven characteristics of immersive learning:

| Letter | Characteristic | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **I** | Integrative | Unifies interdisciplinary principles across the curriculum |
| **M** | Multisensory | Engages visual, verbal, physical, and digital modalities |
| **M** | Motivational | Inspires students through interactive, engaging experiences |
| **E** | Emotional | Connects learning to what students personally care about |
| **R** | Relevant | Extends beyond theory into practical, real-world application |
| **S** | Synergistic | Creates team-based collaboration with real external stakeholders |
| **E** | Experiential | Hands-on, real-world learning — not simulations |

## The IMMERSE + SAIL Connection (THIS IS THE STORY)

### The Insight

IMMERSE = HOW students learn (the pedagogy)
SAIL = WHAT students become (the competencies)

IMMERSE creates the conditions where SAIL competencies are developed. They are two halves of the same educational philosophy. This is NOT two separate programs awkwardly stitched together — they are deeply complementary:

- IMMERSE provides the REAL experiences
- SAIL provides the FRAMEWORK for developing judgment and ownership within those experiences
- Together they answer: "How do you prepare graduates for an AI-augmented world?" Answer: You IMMERSE them in real challenges and develop their SAIL competencies through those challenges.

### How They Map Together

| SAIL Pillar | IMMERSE Characteristic | Real Example |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Social Intelligence | Synergistic, Emotional | Presenting strategy to the Boston Celtics front office |
| AI Literacy | Integrative, Multisensory | Analyzing 100,000 orders with AI in Prompt AIChemy |
| Innovation/Inquiry | Relevant, Experiential | "We need to make sure we're not penalizing rural sellers" |
| Leadership/Ownership | All seven characteristics | Signing off on a recommendation to an actual client who will implement it |

### The Brand Promise

"Two award-winning frameworks. One school. Where immersive experience meets AI leadership."

No other business school has BOTH:
- A nationally recognized immersive learning framework (IMMERSE, 2024)
- A nationally recognized AI leadership framework (SAIL, 2025)
- Back-to-back Eduventures Innovation Awards
- Both published in AACSB Insights

This is the differentiation. This is why Suffolk.
