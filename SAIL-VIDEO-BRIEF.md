# SAIL Framework Promo Video — Creative Brief

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Build a **90-second cinematic marketing video** for Suffolk University's Sawyer Business School. This video recruits prospective students by showing them that SAIL offers something no other business school does: a framework for thriving alongside AI, not just using it.

This is NOT an explainer video. This is NOT a corporate overview. This is a **brand film**. Think Apple "Think Different." Think Nike "Find Your Greatness." Emotional, bold, aspirational. A prospective student watches this and thinks: *"I need to be there."*

## ASPECT RATIO & FORMAT

- **Resolution:** 1080 x 1920 (9:16 vertical — mobile-first, social-shareable)
- **Frame rate:** 30fps
- **Duration:** 90 seconds (2700 frames)
- **Output:** MP4

Also create a `SAILFrameworkPromoHorizontal` composition at 1920x1080 (16:9) for presentations and website embedding. Same content, adapted layout.

## THE STORY ARC (7 Scenes)

---

### Scene 1: THE TENSION (frames 0–300, 10 seconds)

**Concept:** Start with discomfort. Make the viewer feel the problem.

Dark screen. Silence. Then text appears, one line at a time, with deliberate pacing:

```
"Everyone is learning AI."
(beat — 2 seconds of nothing)
"Almost nobody is learning ownership."
(beat)
"That's a problem."
```

**Visual style:**
- Pure typography on dark background
- Each line fades in with subtle scale (starts at 98%, arrives at 100%)
- Minimal ambient particles in the background (like distant stars)
- Use the serif headline font, large, centered
- The word "ownership" should be in the accent color
- After "That's a problem." — hold for a beat, then a subtle pulse ripple emanates from center

**Animation notes:**
- Line 1 appears at frame 30 (1s in)
- Line 2 appears at frame 120 (4s in)
- Line 3 appears at frame 210 (7s in)
- Everything fades out at frame 270-300

---

### Scene 2: THE STAKES (frames 300–540, 8 seconds)

**Concept:** The cognitive debt visualization. Make the abstract concrete.

**Text:** "What happens when AI gets it wrong — and you can't tell?"

**Visual:**
- The text appears as a question floating in space
- Below it, visualize "cognitive debt" — a counter or meter that fills up
- Small text labels drift past: "accepted without checking" ... "looked right" ... "seemed reasonable" ... "didn't question it"
- The meter fills to critical — then a crack/fracture visual
- This is the MIT research made visceral

**Tone:** Unsettling. This should create tension that the rest of the video resolves.

---

### Scene 3: THE FRAMEWORK (frames 540–990, 15 seconds)

**Concept:** SAIL as the answer. Each pillar reveals with purpose.

**Opening:** "There's a framework for this." (small text, humble, then clears)

**Then each pillar gets ~3 seconds:**

**S — Social Intelligence**
- Letter "S" appears large, transforms/reveals the words "Social Intelligence"
- Subtitle: "How do we connect?"
- Color: #4A90D9 (intelligent blue)
- Visual motif: connection lines forming between nodes

**A — AI Literacy**
- Letter "A" appears, transforms to "AI Literacy"
- Subtitle: "How does it work?"
- Color: #4ECDC4 (teal)
- Visual motif: layers/depth revealing (like peeling back)

**I — Innovation / Inquiry**
- Letter "I" appears, transforms to "Innovation / Inquiry"
- Subtitle: "What's missing or wrong?"
- Color: #E85D75 (coral/rose — The Pulse signature)
- Visual motif: a magnifying glass or lens effect — looking closer

**L — Leadership**
- Letter "L" appears, transforms to "Leadership"
- Subtitle: "I will own what happens."
- Color: #C4A44E (Suffolk gold)
- Visual motif: a signature line, like someone signing their name to a decision
- This subtitle is DIFFERENT from the others (it's a declaration, not a question) — make it visually distinct. Bolder. More weight.

**Integration moment (3 seconds):**
- All four letters S-A-I-L arrange together
- Connection lines form between them showing the Integration Effect
- They pulse together once, like a heartbeat
- Subtitle: "The integration is what matters."

---

### Scene 4: THE PROOF — PROMPT ALCHEMY (frames 990–1590, 20 seconds)

**Concept:** Show, don't tell. The competition in action.

**Opening text:** "We didn't just theorize. We tested it."

**Then a rapid, energetic sequence:**

- "19 students. 100,000 real orders. One challenge."
- Kinetic typography of the energy: fragments of what students said and did:
  - "Try being more specific about customer segmentation"
  - Data visualization elements: bar charts, scatter plots, regional maps of Brazil — abstract/stylized, not literal
  - "What if we analyze seasonal patterns first?"
  - A pie chart or radar chart animating
  - "Wait — we're penalizing rural sellers."
  - Record scratch / visual pause moment — this is the INQUIRY pillar in action

- **The ethical moment (highlight this):**
  - The screen stills. One quote appears with weight:
  - "We need to make sure we're not penalizing rural sellers with poor infrastructure."
  - Small label: "— unprompted"
  - This is the moment that proves SAIL works. Students raised ethics on their own.

**Tone:** Energetic, fast-paced, intellectual excitement. Like being in a room full of smart people who care.

---

### Scene 5: THE VOICES (frames 1590–1950, 12 seconds)

**Concept:** Let the students speak. Intimate, direct.

Two quotes, rendered as if someone is speaking directly to the viewer:

**Quote 1 (6 seconds):**
```
"I used to think AI was about getting
the right technical answer.

Now I realize it's more like
conducting an orchestra."
```
- Attribution: "— Suffolk Business Student"
- Render with quotation marks, serif font, gentle fade-in
- Subtle warm glow behind the text

**Quote 2 (6 seconds):**
```
"We weren't just asking AI
for answers.

We were teaching it to think through
problems the way we would."
```
- Same treatment
- These are REAL quotes from the published AACSB article

**Tone:** Warm, personal, contemplative. The energy drops from Scene 4's excitement to something more reflective.

---

### Scene 6: THE THESIS (frames 1950–2250, 10 seconds)

**Concept:** The line that stays with people. THE moment of the video.

**This must be the most visually striking scene.** Everything before has been building to this.

Three lines appear, one at a time, each with MORE visual weight than the last:

```
"Skills can be automated."
```
- Medium text size. Clean. Matter-of-fact.
- Appears, holds 2 seconds.

```
"Judgment can be augmented."
```
- Slightly larger. This is the surprising honest admission.
- Appears, holds 2 seconds.

```
"Ownership cannot."
```
- SIGNIFICANTLY larger. Different weight. This is the punchline.
- The word "Ownership" should be in Suffolk gold (#C4A44E)
- Subtle glow/pulse effect on "cannot"
- Hold for 3 seconds. Let it breathe.

**Background:** During this scene, the particle field slowly intensifies, converging toward center, as if the whole visual field is focusing on this idea.

---

### Scene 7: THE CLOSE (frames 2250–2700, 15 seconds)

**Concept:** Institutional credibility + call to action.

**Beat 1 (5 seconds):** The promise
```
"Not just AI-literate graduates.
Graduates with ownership."
```
- Elegant serif, centered, warm tone

**Beat 2 (5 seconds):** The school
- Suffolk University Sawyer Business School wordmark/text
- "SAIL — AI Leadership Collaborative"
- Credibility badges (text-based, elegant, not cluttered):
  - "AACSB Accredited"
  - "2025 Eduventures Innovation Award"
  - "Published in AACSB Insights"

**Beat 3 (5 seconds):** Call to action
- "suffolk.edu/business"
- A single heartbeat pulse animation (🫀 The Pulse motif)
- Fade to black

## INPUT PROPS SCHEMA

## CRITICAL CREATIVE DIRECTION

1. **This is NOT a corporate video.** No stock imagery vibes. No "diverse group of students smiling at laptops." Pure typography, motion, and emotion.

2. **The pacing should breathe.** Silence and space are as important as content. Let the big moments land. Don't fill every frame.

3. **Scene 6 is the climax.** Everything builds to "Ownership cannot." Treat it like the drop in a song. Everything before is the build-up.

4. **The L pillar is special.** In Scene 3, the other three pillars ask questions ("How do we connect?", "How does it work?", "What's missing or wrong?"). The L pillar makes a DECLARATION: "I will own what happens." This should feel visually and tonally different — bolder, more personal, warmer.

5. **The ethical moment in Scene 4 is the emotional proof.** Students raised fairness concerns UNPROMPTED. The word "— unprompted" should hit like a revelation.

Now build this. Make it extraordinary.
